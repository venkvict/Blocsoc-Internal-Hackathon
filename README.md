Project Description

The NFT-QR-Based Merchandise Platform is a blockchain-based application designed to mint, trade, and verify ownership of unique 
merchandise items represented as non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The platform also includes a lottery system for selecting random winners 
from the NFT holders, offering special fan benefits and rewards. By leveraging blockchain technology, this platform provides a secure, 
transparent, and engaging way for fans to own and trade unique merchandise.

Individual Team Member Contributions

Venkat:
Developed functionalities for minting NFTs with owner verification, ensuring that only verified owners can mint NFTs.
Tested the minting functionalities on Ganache Truffle.
Attempted to implement zero-knowledge (zk) proof for verifying NFT ownership.
Shraddha:
Designed and implemented the user interface using HTML and CSS to create a visually appealing and responsive layout.
Integrated the front end with Next.js to build a robust, server-rendered React application.
Utilized Ether.js to facilitate seamless interactions with the Ethereum blockchain.
Challenges Faced

Integration of Smart Contracts with Frontend:

As newcomers to integration, we found connecting smart contracts with the front end to be quite time-consuming.
Learning to use Ether.js for the first time presented a steep learning curve.
Creating and Verifying zk Proof:

We encountered significant challenges in creating and verifying zk proofs, which prevented us from implementing this feature in our solution.
Optimizing Smart Contracts for Trading:

We faced difficulties in writing the trading part of the smart contract, leading to suboptimal methods that resulted in higher gas consumption.
Learnings from the Hackathon

Time Management: We realized that we spent too much time in the ideation phase, which limited our ability to implement all planned features.
Technical Skills: We gained substantial knowledge about Next.js and Ether.js.
Testing and Debugging: We learned the basics of testing and debugging code, which will be invaluable for future projects.
Future Goals

Implement zk Proof: Complete the implementation of zk proof for verifying authenticity.
Enhance UI: Create a more polished and user-friendly interface for the platform.
Optimize Smart Contracts: Use more efficient smart contract techniques to reduce gas consumption.
